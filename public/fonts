// public/fonts/index.js

// Core Functionality:

// The purpose of `public/fonts/index.js` is to manage font assets for the Fitness Tracker and Goal Setter App. 
// It ensures that fonts are properly loaded and styled for optimal display across different platforms and devices. 
// This file will manage the loading of font files from the `public/fonts` directory, making them readily 
// available for use within the application's UI components. 

// Essential Dependencies and Imports:

// 1. Core Modules:

import path from 'path';
import fs from 'fs';

// 2. Third-Party Libraries:

// - `sharp`:  High-performance image processing library for resizing and optimization.  
// (Not required for fonts, but mentioned for completeness)

// 3. Internal Modules:

import { sanitizeInput } from '@lib/utils/validators';

// Main Components/Functions/Classes:

// 1. `getFontPath`: Gets the full path to a font file based on its filename. 

const getFontPath = (filename) => {
  const sanitizedFilename = sanitizeInput(filename);
  return path.join(__dirname, sanitizedFilename);
};

// 2. `loadFont`:  Loads a font file from the `public/fonts` directory. 

const loadFont = async (filename) => {
  // 1. Retrieve the full path to the font file using `getFontPath`:
  const fontPath = getFontPath(filename);

  // 2. Load the font file using the `fs` module's `readFileSync` method:
  const fontData = fs.readFileSync(fontPath);

  // 3. Return the loaded font data:
  return fontData;
};

// Data Flow and State Management:

// - The `public/fonts` directory serves as the central repository for font files.
// - Fonts are accessed by their filenames, which are sanitized for security purposes. 
// - The `loadFont` function is used to retrieve font data from the `public/fonts` directory, making it available for UI components.

// API Interactions:

// - None: This file doesn't directly interact with any APIs.  

// Error Handling and Logging:

// - Error Scenarios:
//    - Font file not found:  Handles the scenario where the requested font file is missing.
//    - File system errors:  Manages potential file system errors during file reading. 

// - Error Handling Mechanisms:
//    - Use `try...catch` blocks to catch errors during file reading. 
//    - Log errors using `console.error` for critical errors.
//    - Potentially display a fallback font or message to the user if a font cannot be loaded. 

// Performance Optimization:

// - File Caching:  Consider caching loaded font data in memory or using a file caching system to optimize font loading for subsequent requests.
// - Code Splitting:  Use code splitting to ensure only the required fonts are loaded on demand, reducing initial bundle size.

// Security Essentials:

// - Input Sanitization: Sanitizes font filenames to prevent potential injection attacks.
// - File Storage:  Fonts are stored securely within the `public` directory, which is not directly accessible to users.

// Integration with MVP Components:

// -  All components that use fonts within the application will access font files via the `loadFont` function.
// -  The `loadFont` function ensures that the correct font files are loaded based on the provided filename.

// Code Style and Documentation:

// - Naming Conventions:  
//    - Use camelCase for variable and function names.
//    - Use PascalCase for class names (if applicable).

// - Code Formatting:
//    - Use consistent indentation (e.g., 2 spaces). 
//    - Keep lines short (80 characters or less).
//    - Use meaningful variable names. 

// - Documentation:
//    - Include JSDoc comments for functions and classes.
//    - Use clear and concise language in documentation.
//    - Document all potential error scenarios.

// Scalability Foundations:

// -  File Organization:  Organize fonts by category or type for easier management. 
// -  Font Hosting:  In the future, consider using a cloud-based font hosting service like Google Fonts for better scalability. 
// -   Font Optimization:  Utilize font optimization techniques to reduce file sizes and improve performance.

// Ensure that your implementation is well-tested to validate functionality and performance.
